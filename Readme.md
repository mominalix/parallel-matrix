### Parallel Matrix is a mesh of high performance parallel computing and communication APIs

##### This project demonstrates the flow of data process through different parallel computing APIs 

Random number generation in openmp

Random number generation in python

transferring to opencl and cuda from python to through socket programming

transferring to opencl and cuda from openmp throgh pipes

opencl applies addition on both arrays and passes to opengl for visualization

cuda applies addition on both arrays and passes to opengl for visualization

OpenGL shows both input arrays visualizations for comparison
